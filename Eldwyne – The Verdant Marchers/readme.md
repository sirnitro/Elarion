# 🌾 Eldwyne – The Verdant Marches

> “Peace is a mask, and the soil remembers.” – Old Eldwynian Saying

Eldwyne is the pastoral heart of Elarion, a land of golden fields, winding rivers, and hidden roots that stretch deeper than most realize. Though it appears peaceful on the surface, Eldwyne is a realm of buried secrets, ancient pacts, and political crossroads that have shaped the destinies of empires for centuries.

## 📖 History & Myth

Eldwyne was once part of the **First Concord**, a continent-spanning alliance of mortal and fey. When the alliance shattered in the **Veil Sundering**, the land sealed itself off, physically and magically, becoming a sanctuary for the weary—but also a prison for truths too dangerous to share.

Centuries later, much of that history has faded into legend, hidden in **leyline wells**, **speaking stones**, and the bloodlines of unsuspecting villagers.

## 🛐 Religion & Culture

Eldwyne’s people value **balance**, **ancestral memory**, and **quiet faith**. Shrines are often found in groves, kitchens, or crossroads rather than towering temples.

- **Ancestral Binding** – The spirits of family watch over homes and fields; it's taboo to build over graves.
