# ⛰️ Grond Karag – The Stonefather’s Spine

> “We do not build kingdoms. We carve them from the bones of the world.” – Dwarven Forge-Proverb

Grond Karag, also known as the **Stonefather’s Spine**, is a mountainous land of granite pride, molten heartfires, and enduring legacy. Carved into volcanic ridges and deep caverns, the continent is home to mighty strongholds, ancient forges, and the relentless rhythm of hammers echoing across the stone halls.

This is a land where tradition and craftsmanship are sacred, and where the earth itself is both weapon and witness.

## 🧭 Geography

Grond Karag stretches across a jagged continent dominated by the **Titan’s Backbone** — a central mountain range so high it scrapes the sky and fractures the weather. Beneath its peaks lie countless tunnel networks, magma rivers, and subterranean cities.

### Notable Locations:
- **Khaz’Dorrun** – The legendary tiered capital built into the walls of a still-active volcano.
- **Mol-Baraz** – A molten chasm where dwarven clerics commune with the Elemental Plane of Fire.
- **The Hall of Echoes** – A chamber where voices whispered are recorded for eternity in the stone.
- **The Emberdeep Forge** – A mythic smithy said to have been built by the god Morndin himself.

## 🛠️ Inhabitants

- **Mountain Dwarves** – Traditionalists who honor the Stonefather and their ancestral bloodlines.
- **Goliaths** – Hardy nomads who traverse the peaks and serve as guardians of forgotten paths.
- **Stonekin** – Earth elemental hybrids born of leyline ruptures; considered both miracle and curse.
- **Tunnelfolk** – Isolated deep-dwellers who rarely emerge and speak an ancient dialect of Dwarvish.

## 📖 History & Myth

Grond Karag was forged during the **Stone Awakening**, when the gods of forge and fire walked the earth. Dwarves believe the continent was once the body of a sleeping titan, and their cities are chiseled into his bones as acts of devotion.

The **Forge War**, a centuries-old civil war between rival dwarf clans, nearly shattered the continent. It ended with the **Binding of Flame**, a truce sealed in the volcanic heart of Khaz’Dorrun and watched over by eternal flame golems.

## 🛐 Religion & Culture

Grond Karag’s people are deeply spiritual, but their gods are craftsmen, warriors, and earth-shapers—not distant celestial beings.

### Common Beliefs:

- **The Great Chain** – All dwarves are a link in a divine chain of labor, legacy, and honor.
- **Flaws Must Be Forged** – Personal imperfections are viewed like metal impurities—meant to be smelted away by challenge.

### Festivals:
- **The Ember Rite** – A coming-of-age where youths must forge an item worthy of their family name.
- **Day of Echoes** – A solemn holiday where ancestors are honored by speaking into the Hall of Echoes.
