# 🌾 First Light in Eldwyne

> *The land exhales mist as you wake.*

Cold dew clings to your boots.  
You are standing at the edge of a quiet field just before dawn, where tall grass bends under the weight of silver fog. Somewhere nearby, a bell tolls once—low, patient, and unfinished.

This place feels old.  
Not ruined. Not hostile.  
Simply… watching.

A worn stone marker rises from the soil at your feet, half-swallowed by moss. Faint symbols are carved into it—smoothed by time, but not erased.

The air smells of earth and bread smoke.

You are not alone.  
But no one is here.
