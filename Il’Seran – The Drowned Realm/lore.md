# 🌊 Il'Seran – The Drowned Realm

> “The tides remember what the land has long forgotten.” – Ancient Serani Proverb

Il’Seran is the mysterious and awe-inspiring Drowned Realm—an archipelago of scattered islands, sunken ruins, and deep-sea kingdoms lost in the currents of time. Once a vast and fertile continent, Il’Seran was swallowed by the sea during the **First Tearing**, a cataclysmic event blamed on the wrath of forgotten gods or the breaking of the Veil itself.

## 🧭 Geography

Il’Seran consists of dozens of islands, reefs, and atolls surrounded by turbulent waters and deep, abyssal trenches. Most surface islands are home to **fisher clans**, **coral druids**, or **pirate enclaves**, while the real power lies **beneath the waves**.

### Notable Locations:
- **Nymira** – Capital city built from living coral, lies deep beneath the central reef. Protected by ancient runes and Veil currents.
- **The Mirror Abyss** – A massive underwater trench said to be a gateway to the elemental plane of water—or a slumbering god’s tomb.
- **Shal’Nohr’s Ring** – A circle of floating rocks that glow during celestial alignments, used by sea prophets.
- **Stormwrath Spire** – A jagged sea needle where storm druids conduct weather rituals.

## 🧜‍♀️ Inhabitants

- **Sea Elves** – Elegant, wise, and mystical. Rule the underwater cities with diplomacy and quiet power.
- **Tritons** – Military-minded and proud protectors of the deeper trenches.
- **Merfolk** – Nomadic, curious, and deeply spiritual. Many serve as seers or lorekeepers.
- **Surface Dwellers** – Humans, tieflings, and halflings who eke out lives on the wind-battered islands.
- **Ghostwalkers** – Undead spirits or cursed seafarers bound to the sunken ruins. Some are hostile; others guide travelers.

## 📖 History & Myth

### The First Tearing:
Thousands of years ago, Il’Seran was a single landmass teeming with life. But when a **god of the deep**—name lost to time—was betrayed and bound beneath the ocean, his curse shattered the continent and pulled it under.

Survivors fled to the mountaintops (now islands), and the underwater races adapted or emerged in the aftermath. It is whispered that the Veil itself is **thinner in Il’Seran**, warping time and drawing lost sailors from different eras into the present.
