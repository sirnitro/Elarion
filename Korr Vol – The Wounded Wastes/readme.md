# 🔥 Korr Vol – The Wounded Wastes

> “We do not fear the fire. We are born of it.” – Inscription above the Gates of Grak’Zul

Korr Vol, also known as **The Wounded Wastes**, is a land scarred by fire and fury—where red sands whisper tales of conquest, and volcanoes belch smoke into a blood-stained sky. Once fertile and lush, the continent was shattered during the **Ashfall Rebellion**, when elemental and divine forces collided, leaving behind a realm of molten valleys, ash plains, and ancient craters.

Now, Korr Vol is a crucible where honor, power, and survival define life—and where a divine warlord seeks to unite its clans under a single burning banner.

## 📖 History & Myth

Korr Vol was once the seat of the **Ember Concord**, an empire of fire-wielders and elemental shapers. But greed, pride, and divine rebellion tore the land apart in the **Ashfall Rebellion**, when a mortal named **Vorrak Flamebound** tried to ascend to godhood using a Veil Shard.

His failure caused the **Skycrack**, an explosion that sundered the land and marked Korr Vol as cursed—but also **powerful**. Since then, warlords have vied for dominance, seeking to claim the legacy of Vorrak and harness the land’s latent might.
