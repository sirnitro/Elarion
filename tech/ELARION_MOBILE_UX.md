# 📱 Elarion Mobile UX Specification
> *“A world that fits in a pocket must still feel vast.”*

This document defines the **mobile-first user experience** for Elarion:  
a text-driven, stateful, multiplayer narrative RPG designed to be played comfortably on phones without sacrificing depth, immersion, or consequence.

## 🧠 Core Mobile Design Philosophy

### 1. Text Is the Primary Interface
- No sprites
- No maps required
- No precision tapping
- Language, memory, and choice drive engagement

### 2. Thumb-First Interaction
- All primary actions reachable with one hand
- Bottom-of-screen interaction zone
- Minimal typing required

### 3. Asynchronous by Design
- Safe to pause at any time
- Graceful reconnects
- No punishment for short sessions

---

## 🧱 Layout Structure (Portrait First)

### 🔝 Top Bar — World Context
Always visible, minimal height.

Contains:
- Current location / situation name
- Subtle status indicators (health, conditions)
- Time / world-state icon (day, night, anomaly)

Purpose:
- Orientation without clutter
- Instant “where am I?” clarity

---

### 📜 Main Scroll Area — Narrative Feed
The heart of the experience.

Displays:
- World descriptions
- NPC dialogue
- Event outcomes
- Player actions (logged narratively)

Rules:
- Scrollable
- Older entries collapse automatically
- Key moments visually emphasized (bold, spacing, icons)

> This is not chat.  
> This is **the story unfolding**.

---

### 👇 Bottom Action Tray — The Verb Engine
Primary interaction zone (thumb reach).

Contains **contextual actions**, dynamically generated by the engine:
- Talk
- Observe
- Travel
- Act
- Recall

No free-text required for core play.

Actions:
- Appear/disappear based on state
- May expand into sub-options
- Always explain *why* something is unavailable

---

## 🧭 Navigation Model (No Maps)

Movement and interaction use **semantic navigation**, not spatial precision.

Examples:
- “Travel to Meadowhearth”
- “Follow the Emerald Causeway”
- “Enter the Whispering Weald”

Benefits:
- Faster decisions
- Clear intent
- Zero spatial confusion

---

## 🗣️ Communication UX (Multiplayer-Friendly)

### Local Interaction
- NPC dialogue appears inline in the narrative feed
- Other players’ actions appear as world events, not chat spam

### Player Messaging
- Private messages via overlay panel
- Group/party messages contextualized
- No global chat by default (opt-in only)

Chat is treated as **events**, not noise.

---

## 🧠 Memory & Recall UX

A dedicated **Recall Panel** provides:
- Recent decisions
- Known secrets
- Active world tensions
- Faction standings
- Dreams, visions, prophecies

This replaces:
- Quest logs
- Minimap markers
- UI clutter

> The player remembers because the world does.

---

## ⏸️ Pause, Resume, Reconnect

### Pausing
- Player can exit at any time
- World state saved instantly
- No forced “end turn” mechanics

### Reconnect
- Resume exactly where left
- Narrative summary of any changes
- Clear indication if the world advanced without them

---

## 🔔 Notifications (Optional, Later Phase)

Mobile-friendly, lore-consistent notifications:
- “The world has shifted.”
- “Someone remembers what you did.”
- “A distant bell rings in Meadowhearth.”

No spam. Only significance.

---

## 🌗 Accessibility & Comfort

- Adjustable text size
- Dark mode by default
- High-contrast option
- Minimal animation
- Low-bandwidth friendly

Elarion should be readable:
- At night
- In motion
- When tired

---

## 🧪 Input Modes (Advanced)

### Default Mode
- Tap-driven actions
- Guided choices
- Zero typing required

### Advanced Mode (Optional)
- Text input for custom actions
- Command suggestions (auto-complete)
- Power-user friendly

Same engine. Different skin.

---

## ⚠️ UX Anti-Goals (Do Not Do These)

- ❌ Tiny buttons
- ❌ Walls of unbroken text
- ❌ Mandatory typing
- ❌ Real-time reaction requirements
- ❌ Map-dependent progression
- ❌ “You must be online now” events

---

## 🧭 Final UX Rule

Every screen must answer **one question clearly**:

> *“What is happening — and what can I do next?”*

If it does not, the screen does not belong.

---

## Closing Thought
Elarion on mobile is not a compromise.  
It is the **purest form of the world**—quiet, personal, remembered.

A game you don’t boot up.

A world you step back into.
